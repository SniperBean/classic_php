echo "<pre>he only difference is â€” the include() statement will only generate a PHP warning but allow script execution to continue if the file to be included can't be found, whereas the require() statement will generate a fatal error and stops the script execution.
Tip: It is recommended to use the require() statement if you're including the library files or files containing the functions and configuration variables that are essential for running your application, such as database configuration file.
